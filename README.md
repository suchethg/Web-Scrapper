# Web-Scrapper

Introduction
Many data analysis, big data, and machine learning projects require scraping websites to gather the data that you’ll be working with. The Python programming language is widely used in the data science community, and therefore has an ecosystem of modules and tools that you can use in your own projects. 

Beautiful Soup, an allusion to the Mock Turtle’s song found in Chapter 10 of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, is a Python library that allows for quick turnaround on web scraping projects. Currently available as Beautiful Soup 4 and compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3, Beautiful Soup creates a parse tree from parsed HTML and XML documents (including documents with non-closed tags or tag soup and other malformed markup).

Prerequisites
Before Scraping a particulare website, you should have a local or server-based Python programming environment set up on your machine.

You should have the Requests and Beautiful Soup modules installedand.
